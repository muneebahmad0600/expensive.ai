    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>November 14, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>{{APP_NAME}}</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the App. The App is an expense-tracking application that includes an optional audio-to-expense feature that requires microphone access.</p>

    <h2>Summary — What you should know</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App collects personal and non-personal information required to create and manage expense entries (for example: amount, date, category, notes).</li>
      <li>The App requests and uses the **microphone** permission only for audio-to-expense features (voice input that converts spoken entries to expense items). You control this permission and can revoke it at any time. See “How to control permissions” below.</li>
      <li>If you use transcription or backup features that upload audio or other data to our servers, that data is transmitted securely (HTTPS) and retained only as described below.</li>
      <li>We may use third-party analytics and crash-reporting services. You can opt out of analytics; see the Settings or contact us.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information when you use the App:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Data Type</th>
          <th>Collected?</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Account information (email, display name)</td>

          <td>To create and manage your account, sign in, and send important notices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Expense data (amounts, dates, categories, notes)</td>
          <td>Yes</td>

          <td>Audio recordings / voice input</td>
          <td>Yes — only if you enable voice-to-expense</td>
          <td>Transcription to convert speech into expense entries</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Device & usage data (device model, OS version, crash logs, analytics)</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>App performance, crash diagnostics, usage analytics to improve the App</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Optional: Contacts, Photos, Files</td>
          <td>Only if you explicitly enable features that require them</td>

  <section>
    <h2>Microphone & audio processing (important)</h2>
    <p>The App requests access to your device's microphone solely to provide the audio-to-expense feature. Microphone access is <strong>optional</strong>. If you do not permit microphone access, voice features will not function but the rest of the App will work normally.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>How audio is processed:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device processing:</strong> When possible, the App transcribes audio on the device (no audio leaves your device). This provides the highest privacy. — <em>If your app uses on-device transcription, keep this line.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Server-side processing:</strong> If you opt into backup or improved transcription, audio may be uploaded to our servers or a third-party transcription service for processing. Uploaded audio is transmitted over TLS/HTTPS and stored only as long as needed to provide the feature and for debugging (see “Data retention” below). — <em>If your app uploads audio, keep this line and replace with your hosting/service details.</em></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Note to developer:</strong> If your app uploads audio to a server or third-party service (e.g., a speech-to-text provider), ensure you list the provider(s) by name here and in the Play Console / App Store Connect privacy fields.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services to provide analytics, crash reporting, authentication and hosting. These services may collect device identifiers and usage information. Common examples include Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics), Google Play Services, and other SDKs. We do not sell your personal information.</p>
    <p>If you rely on any third-party SDKs, list them here (replace or extend):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firebase (Analytics, Authentication, Crashlytics) — if used</li>
      <li>Google Play Services — for in-app updates, billing, etc., if used</li>
      <li>Speech-to-text provider — e.g., (replace with provider name) — if you upload audio to a third-party</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each third-party provider has its own privacy policy. We recommend linking to them where applicable.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve the App and its features.</li>
      <li>To process and store your expense records and attachments.</li>
      <li>To transcribe audio when you use voice features (with your permission).</li>
      <li>To send account-related communications (optional): password resets, notifications.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and diagnose technical issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal data and expense records for as long as your account exists or as required to provide the service, resolve disputes, comply with legal obligations, or fulfill legitimate business needs. If you request deletion, we will remove your data from active systems and anonymize or delete backups within a reasonable time frame.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing & disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, payment processors, transcription) — limited to the data necessary for those services.</li>
      <li>When required by law or to respond to legal requests (court order, subpoena).</li>
      <li>To protect rights, safety or property of users or the public.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your rights and choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Export a copy of your data in a common format (e.g., CSV/JSON).</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain processing (where applicable).</li>
      <li>Opt out of analytics and marketing communications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:muneeb.ahmad0600@gmail.com">muneeb.ahmad0600@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.</p>

    <h2>How to control microphone permission</h2>
    <p><strong>Android:</strong> Open <em>Settings → Apps → {{APP_NAME}} → Permissions → Microphone</em> and toggle allowed/denied.</p>
    <p><strong>iOS:</strong> Open <em>Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone</em> and toggle microphone access for the App.</p>
    <p>If you revoke microphone permission, voice features will stop working but your existing recorded data (if any) will remain until you delete it or request deletion.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data (encryption in transit, secure servers, access controls). However, no system is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a data breach affecting your personal information occurs, we will follow applicable laws and notify you where required.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be stored and processed in countries other than your country of residence. By using the App and providing information, you consent to such transfers, subject to applicable law and protections.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Policy changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. When we make significant changes, we will post a prominent notice in the App and update the effective date above. Your continued use after changes means you accept the new policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
